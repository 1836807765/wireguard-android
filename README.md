# Android GUI for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)

### [Test this app on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.wireguard.android).

This is an Android GUI for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). It [opportunistically uses the kernel implementation](https://git.zx2c4.com/android_kernel_wireguard/about/), and falls back to using the non-root [userspace implementation](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/).
