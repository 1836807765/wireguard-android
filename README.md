# Android GUI for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)

**[Download from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android)**

This is an Android GUI for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). It [opportunistically uses the kernel implementation](https://git.zx2c4.com/android_kernel_wireguard/about/), and falls back to using the non-root [userspace implementation](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/).

## Building

```
$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-android
$ cd wireguard-android
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ ./gradlew assembleRelease
```
